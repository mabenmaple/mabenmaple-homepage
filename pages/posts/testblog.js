        Tucker during his visit to Moscow in early February 2024 <a href="https://twitter.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1754939251257475555">[1]</a>
      </P>
      <P>
        Tucker Carlson&apos;s ongoing visit to Moscow is a topic of hot debate in the polarised political discourse of websites
        such Elon Musk&apos;s <i>X</i> (Formerly <i>Twitter</i>). I wasn&apos;t initially struck by the fact Tucker Carlson was 
        interviewing one of the most powerful men on the geo-political stage, but instead by the claim Tucker makes that &quot;<i>Not
        a single western journalist has bothered to interview the president of the other country involved in this conflict, Vladimir Putin</i>&quot;. 
        While there are scathes of interviews with Zelenskyy, Biden, Scholz, and other key players involved in the war in Ukraine,
        not a single journalist has tried to interview the man who put boots on the ground on the 20th of February 2022?
      </P>

        <InPostImage src="/images/posts/evan.jpg" alt="Image of Evan Gershkovich detained by Russian State Police" />
        Evan Gershkovich has been detained by Russian authorities for almost a year <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68111693">[2]</a>
      </P>
      <P>
        Of course, further research leads to western journalists being imprisoned by the Russian state for their work in Russia,
        such as Wall Street Journal correspondent Evan Gershkovich who has spent a year in Russian prison fighting espionage charges <a href="#2">[2]</a>.
        Not only that but almost every major media outlet has put in request to interview Putin, a claim by Kremlin spokesperson
        Dmitry Peskov who said Putin chose Tucker specifically because of his &apos;position that differs&apos; from traditional outlets <a href="#3">[3]</a>. Of course this 
        alludes to Tucker&apos;s commentary on the war in Ukraine and his continued opposition to military aid, and his often 
        conspiratorial claims of Ukraine&apos;s involvement in war crimes or Zelenskyy&apos;s supposed degredation of democracy 
        in the nation. Tucker himself, nor his show or work, is inherently special in it&apos;s deviation from mainline political 
        discourse. Tucker is instead a blot on a trendline of ever increasing political radicalisation that targets disproportionately 
        youth voters with idealised authoritarianism.
      </P>

      <P>
        I think it&apos;s misguided to solely blame social media for political radicalisation, but to instead view social media as a driving force
        in which people <i>are</i> radicalised. There is a proven and widening gap in how older and younger generations percieve the functioning
        of democracy, with millenials being the most affected by authoritarian sympathies <a href="#4">[4]</a>.
      </P>
      <P>
        <PostImage src="/images/posts/happyoverdemocracy.png" alt="Graphic of how generations view the functioning of democracy" />
        Polling suggests Millenials, and by extension Generation Z, are the least satisfied with liberal democracy <a href="https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Youth_and_Satisfaction_with_Democracy-lite.pdf">[4]</a>
      </P>
      <P>
        Generation Z has so far been found to have similar views to Millenials, however there are notable polling demographic issues among polls with
        Generation Z that lead to semi-conflicting distrust of democracy in a large minority of those polled while there exists simultaneous overwhelming
        trust in other public institutions <a href="#4">[4]</a> <a href="#5">[5]</a>.

        How young people from different countries lean politically, data from Gallup graphic by Financial times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/29fd9b5c-2f35-41bf-9d4c-994db4e12998">[6]</a>
      </P>
      <P>
        The clearest picture we have of young people&apos;s radicalisation is in the polarity difference between genders <a href="#6">[6]</a>. It&apos;s important to note that 
        South Korea is the culture war capital of the world, with their extreme polarisation between men and women being a facet of ingrained misogyny and the 
        fairly new movement to remove it from Korean society and arguments over the fairness of conscription policies (although this is an entire post in of itself).
        In western democracies women are overwhelmingly liberal in comparison to men, with the gap widening from previous generations <a href="#7">[7]</a> as both genders become 
        more liberal than their parents or grandparents. It&apos;s important to note that the terms of &apos;liberal&apos;, &apos;conservative&apos;, and &apos;centrist&apos; all depend on the 
        context of the political climate of the country in which a person is, which is irrespective of social media and leads to different trend lines between 
        countries despite the gap being present in all 4.
      </P>
      <P>
        Differences in opinion between demographics isn&apos;t unique, but I argue social media removes the human element of political discourse and thus favours 
        dehumanising sensationalism that drives polarisation. Pre-October 7th the &apos;blood and soil&apos; arguments of bygone fascist regimes were exclusively a talking
        point of extreme supremacy groups ranging from the KKK to the Nation of Islam. Left movements do have a checkered history up to the present day with anti-semitism,
        such as in Corybn&apos;s Labour or Melenchon&apos;s various leftist movements, however social media has only served to amplify these backchannel views of a 
        begotten time of labour movements. Once the attack occured, many outraged with Israeli treatment of 
        Palestinians became trapped by bad-faith actors in promoting essentially blood libel; championing &apos;From the River to the Sea&apos;, which on further inspection 
        is effectively dogwhistling the extermination of the state of Israel and all that could possibly come with it. Morally justified concern by left-leaning and 
        progressive people online had been turned into calls for their extermination, spilling over into otherwise peaceful and dutifully conducted protests such 
        as the one experienced in Sydney (Gas the Jews vs Wheres the Jews, it&apos;s the same connotation) <a href="#8">[8]</a>. Post attack anti-semitic posts increased by over 1000%
        on twitter, and have ingratiated themselves in previously niche twitter accounts such as Jackson Hinkle who now has millions of followers from his 
        staunchly pro-Palestinian focus. However as a consequence, he now has an entirely new audience who agree with his posts on the Gaza conflict to peddle his 
        extreme views on Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea <a href="#9">[9]</a>. This, in my opinion, leads to a pervasive form of Confirmation Bias in which you find yourself 
        agreeing with more radical, unfounded viewpoints when said by someone who you agree with on a certain issue you are vehemently passionate about. Why would you
        in good concious support the democracy of the United States, and it&apos;s institutions, when it supports what you view as a genocide in Gaza. Why not support 
        Putin, shunned by the west, but who has called for a ceasefire and is generally closer to the average voter&apos;s opinion on the Gaza war? It&apos;s hard for 
        the average person to accept the driving forces of the geo-political positioning of states, for example in the Gaza war where the liberal United States vetoes 
        the UN call for a ceasefire due to their interests in the region and with Israel.
      </P>

        Social media algorithms push for sensationalism aswell, since it&apos;s what drives clicks, advertisement engagement, et cetera. This is clearly shown from 
        Facebook congressional hearings, with Cambridge Analytica and how their algorithm (knowingly is the wrong word since it&apos;s a black box, more decided) 
        that pushing falsehoods about the certification of the 2020 United States election would further drive revenue <a href="#10">[10]</a>. Tucker, who we haven&apos;t discussed in 
        a few paragraphs, was also guilty of knowingly doing this by questioning the validity of the Dominion electronic voting machines and was brought to court over it,
        in which he successfully had his defence argue he was a &apos;propagandist, entertainer&apos; and not a credible journalist under the &apos;entertainment&apos; company Fox News <a href="#11">[11]</a>.
        And since his ousting from Fox News he&apos;s mascaraded as a legitimate journalist, challenging the uninformed through assertive claims and anecdotal evidence 
        presented as fact in order to drive, again, the fattening of his own pockets. The Tucker style &apos;journalist&apos; not only extends to disgraced media personalities,
        but also to a new revolution of online political streamer, such as Hasan &apos;HasanAbi&apos; Piker, who has consistently parroted conspiracy theories and tankie arguments
        such as calling Taiwan the &apos;confederacy in exile&apos; (yes I am not joking) or having a literal Houthi pirate on his stream and idealising him as some form of rebellious 
        anti-capitalist hero <a href="#12">[12]</a>.

        <PostImage src="/images/posts/geertmeloni.jpg" alt="Picture of Geert Wilders and Giorgia Meloni" />
        Geert Wilders and Giorgia Meloni are two examples of &apos;far-right&apos; leaders who have moderated their policies
      </P>
      <P>
        Although this part of the article has been mainly focused on America, we can also shift focus to Europe where online radicalisation isn&apos;t currently untested,
        anecdotal experiences online backed by polls. There has been a meaningful shift in Europe across all generations further to the right on specific issues, mainly 
        immigration, since 2015. The days of Merkel mass immigration is over, and right wing populists are being elected consistently across differing geographical regions 
        of the continent. Geert Wilders and Giorgia Meloni and notable as they have been actually elected (Geert Wilders still needs to form government, but even if he doesn&apos;t 
        he is favoured to sweep in a snap election), however unlike far right contemporaries à la Trump they&apos;ve had considerable policy changes precipatated by 
        European parliamentary systems. Meloni campaigned as a far-right populist, with ties to the literal successor to Mussolini&apos;s National Fascist Party, but 
        became a right wing centrist once in office and Geert is projected to do the same with his pull-back of the complete ban of the hijab and mosques. It&apos;s 
        semi-offtopic but I think it&apos;s important to keep in mind how political polarisation ends up manifesting in reality under different systems and contexts.

        Polling suggests Australian voting habits are more influenced by policy rather than those heading the parties <a href="https://dataverse.ada.edu.au/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.26193/HPA0BY">[13]</a>
      </P>
      <P>
        On the other hand other countries have had a lack of political polarisation amongst a sea of European and American right wing actors, for example in Australia. 
        I would argue this is generally due to a myriad of factors such as population demographics, HDI, wealth, general political apathy, et cetera. Polling from the 
        Lowy Institute suggests that Australian&apos;s focus more on policy issues, and are more likely to change which party they vote for each election in comparison to an 
        increasingly tribal United States and more in line with European systems <a href="#14">[14]</a>.
        Personally I also think we are just more apathetic to politics, especially younger people as we are forced to vote but it&apos;s hard to find real data to support this so 
        it&apos;s just opinion.

        <PostImage src="/images/posts/diststudy.png" alt="Graphic of distribution of studies on social media political polarisation by geographic region" />
        The majority of studies on political polarisation come from America and Europe <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23808985.2021.1976070">[15]</a>
        <PostImage src="/images/posts/studygobrr.png" alt="Graphic of number of studies published about social media political polarisation" />
        Most studies on this phenomena are fairly recent <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23808985.2021.1976070">[15]</a>
      </P>
      <P>
        There is quite a lot of doom and gloom over the role of social media in shaping people&apos;s perception of politics, and not without merit, however there has been 
        a startling lack of not only academic research but general interest in the depolarisation of social media and the internet in general <a href="#15">[15]</a>. The distribution of 
        polling is overwhelmingly focused on America and Europe, and on political polarisation [15]. The polarisation of social media is, at the root, caused by the 
        overall movement during the internet bubble to rapidly commercialise the internet bringing with it the market forces that precipitate legacy media and the 
        overarching idea of social media and what follows <a href="#16">[16]</a>. The question when viewing the big picture of our relationship with legacy media, social media, and 
        radicalisation in response to contempt at the current states of our societies is to how much importance do we hold the truth? In general, people are simply 
        emotional creatures who would rather read absolutes in echo chambers than maybes in discussion, but do we have a duty to police the internet and make sure 
        everything is true? Who decides that? Contemporary attempts at this include community notes, which to it&apos;s credit is the one good thing to come out of Musks&apos;s 
        Twitter/X but is flawed and at the behest of a man in a mid-life crisis with a saviour complex. 
      </P>
      <P>
        Reading between the lines of the multitude of studies on media polarisation, I think an important facet of the depolarisation of the internet is the lessening 
        focus on revenue driven algorithm&apos;s and how they serve posts. Obviously there&apos;s issues in going to a company and asking them to reduce their profit 
        for something unproven, but all contemporary studies point to social media algorithm&apos;s as a driving factor in the continued radicalisation of users. The 
        current political climate is also to blame, and once the economy begins to fully stabilize (i.e. supermarket and gas costs adjust to the inflation rate) the 
        major driving force of polarisation in the economy is taken away, which has been seen in countries in europe after the global financial crisis. There is a 
        balancing act to be had with one&apos;s personal freedom of expression, the private interests of companies, and the moral duty of liberal democracy to persuade
        against authoritarianism which if managed correctly can continue the boon of access to information that social media and the internet provides.
